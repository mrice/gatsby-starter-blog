Hey Legal Engineers,

It's Sunday morning as I write this. Hope you're having an 
awesome weekend like I am. 

I've been hard at work this weekend doing some smart contract 
development and working on this blog. 

Decided to use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as to generate
the site. If you haven't used one of these site generator tools
before, they're pretty cool. It makes it easy to generate very
fast static sites.

My person site still runs Wordpress because I started with that
like 15 years ago and I still like it, but it's so heavyweight.

I also liked Gatsby partly because I'm just now getting into 
[React](https://reactjs.org/) development for some of the Dapp 
stuff I've been doing. Used to write Angular, which I liked too, 
but the component model of React is fun. Gatsby seems to be 
based on React so I can do  

Finally, I'm hosting it on [Netflify](https://www.netlify.com/), 
which is an **amazing** platform to work with. I feel like I'm
only tapping into like 10% of its power.

And I did get some time to hang out at the beach yesterday,
which might be my biggest accomplishment :-)
